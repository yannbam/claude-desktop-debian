# Claude Desktop for Linux

This project provides build scripts to run Claude Desktop natively on Linux systems. It repackages the official Windows application for Debian-based distributions, producing either `.deb` packages or AppImages.

**Note:** This is an unofficial build script. For official support, please visit [Anthropic's website](https://www.anthropic.com). For issues with the build script or Linux implementation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues) in this repository.

## Features

- **Native Linux Support**: Run Claude Desktop without virtualization or Wine
- **MCP Support**: Full Model Context Protocol integration  
  Configuration file location: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **System Integration**: 
  - Global hotkey support (Ctrl+Alt+Space)
  - System tray integration
  - Desktop environment integration

## Installation

### Using Pre-built Releases

Download the latest `.deb` or `.AppImage` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/releases).

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites

- Debian-based Linux distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, MX Linux, etc.)
- Git
- Basic build tools (automatically installed by the script)

#### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian.git
cd claude-desktop-debian

# Build a .deb package (default)
./build.sh

# Build an AppImage
./build.sh --build appimage

# Build with custom options
./build.sh --build deb --clean no  # Keep intermediate files
```

#### Installing the Built Package

**For .deb packages:**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./claude-desktop_VERSION_ARCHITECTURE.deb

# If you encounter dependency issues:
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

**For AppImages:**
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x ./claude-desktop-*.AppImage

# Run directly
./claude-desktop-*.AppImage

# Or integrate with your system using AppImageLauncher
```

**Note:** AppImage login requires proper desktop integration. Use [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) or manually install the provided `.desktop` file to `~/.local/share/applications/`.

## Configuration

### MCP Configuration

Model Context Protocol settings are stored in:
```
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Application Logs

Runtime logs are available at:
```
$HOME/claude-desktop-launcher.log
```

## Uninstallation

**For .deb packages:**
```bash
# Remove package
sudo dpkg -r claude-desktop

# Remove package and configuration
sudo dpkg -P claude-desktop
```

**For AppImages:**
1. Delete the `.AppImage` file
2. Remove the `.desktop` file from `~/.local/share/applications/`
3. If using AppImageLauncher, use its uninstall option

**Remove user configuration (both formats):**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/Claude
```

## Troubleshooting

### Window Scaling Issues

If the window doesn't scale correctly on first launch:
1. Right-click the Claude Desktop tray icon
2. Select "Quit" (do not force quit)
3. Restart the application

This allows the application to save display settings properly.

### AppImage Sandbox Warning

AppImages run with `--no-sandbox` due to electron's chrome-sandbox requiring root privileges for unprivileged namespace creation. This is a known limitation of AppImage format with Electron applications.

For enhanced security, consider:
- Using the .deb package instead
- Running the AppImage within a separate sandbox (e.g., bubblewrap)

## Technical Details

### How It Works

Claude Desktop is an Electron application distributed for Windows. This project:

1. Downloads the official Windows installer
2. Extracts application resources
3. Replaces Windows-specific native modules with Linux-compatible implementations
4. Repackages as either:
   - **Debian package**: Standard system package with full integration
   - **AppImage**: Portable, self-contained executable

### Build Process

The build script (`build.sh`) handles:
- Dependency checking and installation
- Resource extraction from Windows installer
- Icon processing for Linux desktop standards
- Native module replacement
- Package generation based on selected format

### Updating for New Releases

The script automatically detects system architecture and downloads the appropriate version. If Claude Desktop's download URLs change, update the `CLAUDE_DOWNLOAD_URL` variables in `build.sh`.
